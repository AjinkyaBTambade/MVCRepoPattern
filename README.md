# MvcAppRepositoryPattern:

- **Project Overview:**
  - The project is centered around Human Resource Management, which typically involves managing employee information, payroll, attendance, and other related tasks within an organization.

- **MVC Architecture:**
  - MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. 
  - **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. In this context, it likely includes classes or components responsible for managing employee data, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - **View:** Represents the user interface components. This could be the web pages or user interfaces where HR managers or employees interact with the system.
  - **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It receives input from the View, processes it (often interacting with the Model), and generates an appropriate response (usually updating the View).

- **Repository Pattern:**
  - The Repository Pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software development to separate the logic that retrieves data from a data source (such as a database) from the business logic. 
  - In the context of this project, the Repository Pattern likely involves creating interfaces or classes responsible for querying and persisting data to the MySQL database. These repositories abstract away the details of how data is accessed and manipulated, providing a clean and consistent interface for the rest of the application to interact with the database.

- **Core Folder:**
  - The Core folder likely contains the core functionality of the application, particularly related to interacting with the MySQL database.
  - This could include classes or components representing entities (such as Employee, Department, etc.), repository interfaces or classes, database connection logic, and other related functionality.

- **WebApp Folder:**
  - The WebApp folder likely contains the user interface code of the application.
  - This could include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code (such as C# in the case of ASP.NET MVC) responsible for rendering web pages, handling user input, and interacting with the backend logic (such as controllers and repositories).
